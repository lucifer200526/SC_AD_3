A To-Do List application is a productivity tool that helps users organize, manage, and track tasks efficiently. It allows users to create, edit, and delete tasks, set priorities or deadlines, and mark tasks as completed.

The application helps users plan their daily activities, reduce missed tasks, and improve time management. Some to-do list apps also support reminders, categories, and notifications, making it easier to stay organized and focused.
